## 📌 Overview

This is a front-end web application built in **React with TypeScript**, designed and developed by me. The app integrates with an external backend API and features a login screen and a dynamic search interface. While I used **Cursor AI** as a coding assistant, I personally handled all:

- UI/UX design decisions (color palette, layout, features)
- API integration and frontend logic
- CORS error troubleshooting and resolution

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **API Integration**: Backend provided by collaborator
- **Hosting**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Tools**: Google Cloud Run, Docker

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 **Login Page**: Clean, modern UI with input validation
- 🔍 **Search Interface**: Integrated with backend API for real-time queries
- 🧠 Custom UI/UX planning (colors, layout, features)
- ⚙️ Manual CORS handling for frontend-backend communication
- 💻 Desktop-first responsive design

## ℹ️ Notes

> The backend API was built by a collaborator. I was fully responsible for the frontend architecture, design, and integration. This project includes ~44% TypeScript and reflects thoughtful planning in both aesthetics and functionality.
> **Note:** The Search Page is live, but the backend connection from Google Cloud Platform is currently turned off to save costs. The frontend is fully functional and ready to connect once the backend is active again.
